estaurant Dish Finder
A simple web application that analyzes Google Maps restaurant reviews to find the most popular dishes.
Lets call the website "Dishee"




Requirements
Accept Google Maps URLs in two formats:
Full URL (e.g., https://www.google.com/maps/place/...)
Shortened URL (e.g., https://maps.app.goo.gl/...)




Include a clear Call-to-Action (CTA) button for users to submit the URL
Process last 60 days of reviews using OpenAI API to identify top dishes
Display results on a new page showing:
Up to 3 most popular dishes
Brief description of each dish
Optional: relevant quote from reviews for each dish




Tech Stack
Thought for 1 second### Tech Stack for the Restaurant Dish Recommender


The Restaurant Dish Recommender site is built using a modern web development stack that combines several technologies:


## Core Framework


- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. We're using the App Router architecture (Next.js 13+) which offers improved routing, layouts, and server components.




## Frontend


- **React**: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development




## UI Components


- **shadcn/ui**: A collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Lucide React**: For modern, clean SVG icons




## Backend


- **Next.js Server Actions**: For handling server-side logic directly from client components
- **AI SDK**: Vercel's AI SDK for integrating with OpenAI's models




## AI Integration


- **OpenAI API**: Used via the AI SDK to analyze restaurant reviews and identify top dishes
- **@ai-sdk/openai**: The OpenAI integration for the AI SDK




## Database


- **Supabase**: A PostgreSQL database with a RESTful API for storing and retrieving restaurant and dish data. I am a beginner but my thought for back end is to store restaurants and the top 3 dishes so can cache results and not have to hit the API every time. this is to save money using google places api. Likely will need to create a table for restaurants and a table for dishes.
- **PostgreSQL**: The underlying relational database used by Supabase




## State Management


- **React Hooks**: For local state management (useState, useEffect)




## Styling


- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with utility classes
- **CSS Variables**: For theming and dark mode support




## Deployment Options


- **Vercel**: Optimized for deployment on Vercel (though it can be deployed elsewhere)




## Development Tools


- **npm/Node.js**: Package management and runtime
- **ESLint**: For code linting
- **next-themes**: For theme management (light/dark mode)




## Google Places API(New) Do not use the legacy API
Google Places API (New) to use for reviews and place_id


## Github
here is the link to the repo: https://github.com/glennisaj/dishee
I will need to create a new repo for this project. I am a beginner so I will need to learn how to do this.
I also will need to learn how to use the terminal to navigate the file system and make changes to the code.
