## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Fix Double API Requests in Results Page
**Priority:** Low  
**Type:** Optimization  
**Description:**  
Currently, the results page makes duplicate POST requests to `/api/analyze-reviews` endpoint.

**Current Behavior:**
- Two identical requests are sent
- Both requests complete successfully
- No user-facing issues
- Slightly increased server load

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add AbortController to cancel in-progress requests
- Better handle component cleanup
- Prevent duplicate requests from component re-renders

**Code Location:**
- `app/results/[id]/page.tsx`
- `app/api/analyze-reviews/route.ts`

**Impact:**
- Reduced server load
- Lower API usage
- Cleaner network requests
